"Legend:"

"PHYID =A number in the range 0-127 that is the PHY identifier"
"CURSP =The current negotiated physical link rate for the PHY "
"MAXSP=The hardware maximum physical link rate for the PHY"
"IDWC=Number of invalid dwords that have been received outside of PHY reset sequences"
"RDEC =Number of dwords containing running disparity errors that have been received"
"LDWSC=Times the PHY has restarted the link reset seq. because it lost dword synchronization"
"RPC=Times the PHY did not receive dword synchronization during the final SAS speed negotiation window"
"DATA INVALID=Statistics could not be retrieved or device is a SATA physical disk"
